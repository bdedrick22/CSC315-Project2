# CSC315-Project2
Code for project 2 in CSC 315.

To use this program you will need to specify a messgae string using either simply a string or changing the file. 
Same is true for the output, you either mus comment it out or specify a file.

I strived to use no for or while loops. 
To accomplish this I used a number of higher order functions, and one function (pair creation) I solved recursivly.
I quite liked these functions, but the only one I eventually failed on was trying to add spaces after every 5 characters.
I tried using formated strings, but couldn't get the syntax right so I omited it.
